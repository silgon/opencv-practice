All the files in c or c++ need to be compiled. When you're inside one of the projects (one of the folders inside this path), you can do the next in your terminal:
With CMake:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


With Make:
make comp
After you introduced the code, you'll see the executable file. Good luck ;)
